# Typing Birds

Typing Birds is a fun and challenging typing game where you help a bird navigate through obstacles by typing the correct letters that appear on the screen. The faster and more accurately you type, the further your bird will go without hitting an obstacle. This game was initially developed as part of a challenge to create an interactive web experience using TypeScript.

## Game Overview

Welcome to Typing Birds! In this game, your goal is to help the bird fly through obstacles by typing the correct letter displayed on each pipe. The game starts with easy letters, but as you progress, the speed and complexity increase.

### Rules of the Game

- **Objective**: Help the bird pass through pipes by typing the correct letter shown on each pipe.
- **Gameplay**: If you type the wrong letter or fail to type it in time, the bird will crash into the pipe and the game will be over.
- **Difficulty**: The game begins with easy challenges but increases in speed and complexity as you advance.
- **Goal**: Achieve the highest score possible by passing through as many pipes as you can!

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Used for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To create a responsive design and style the application.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: To render game graphics and animations smoothly.
- **TypeScript**: For ensuring type safety and reducing bugs during development.

## Challenge from STUDIO SOUP

This project was initially inspired by a challenge from **STUDIO SOUP**, which aimed to create a mini-interactive experience using TypeScript in just 8 hours. The requirements included creating an interactive web game or simulation that involved user events (such as mouse/keyboard movements) and dynamic visual elements.

### Key Aspects Evaluated

- **Code Structure**: Clear and organized TypeScript code.
- **User Interaction**: Effective implementation of user interactions.
- **Creativity**: Original and engaging game concept.
- **TypeScript Proficiency**: Proper use of static typing, interfaces, and best practices.

The challenge provided an excellent opportunity to explore creativity while demonstrating strong technical skills, resulting in the creation of **Typing Birds**.
